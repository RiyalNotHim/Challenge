HOW TO RUN

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this project (e.g., 'TaskAutomator/').
3. Run the following command: [cite: 2]

   python src/app.py

4. The script will:
   - Read the 'data/tasks.json' file.
   - Open the Task Automator GUI.
   - Start the background scheduler thread.

5. Once running, you can add, remove, and manage tasks.

====================================================
NOTES

- Requires Python 3.
- All dependencies (Tkinter, JSON, etc.) are in the standard library.
- The scheduler only runs while the GUI application is open.
